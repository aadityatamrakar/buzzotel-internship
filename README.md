Are you a movie buff? Are you someone who would rattle out names of 10 other interesting movies, when someone mentions the name of a movie that they enjoyed? Even if you are not one, we are sure you have one such friend around you.  Can you create a robotic clone of yourself or your friend who is a movie buff? Welcome to the Buzzotel Movie Challenge. Your input is a list of 250 movies along with information about these movies. We would like you to write a program that can identify for every movie in the list, 10 other similar / related movies in the same list in descending order of "similarity". You can define "similarity" however you deem fit for this exercise.
